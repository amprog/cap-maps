    <h2>CAP GRAPHICS</h2>

            <h3>Charts</h3>
            <p>Anyone will be able to create the charts, using simple forms.  Multiple charts should work on the same page.  You will soon be able to build more complicated charts in the near future.</p>

        <h3>SVG Maps and Graphics</h3>
        <p>You will still need a developer to write code to create SVG graphics.  But they can now be added using the wordpress admin, which means that hosting and maintenance will be a lot earlier. You will also not have to wait for any deployments, since you can upload your files as soon as the developer finishes it.  </p>
